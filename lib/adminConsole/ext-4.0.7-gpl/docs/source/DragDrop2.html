</span> * This plugin provides drag and/or drop functionality for a GridView.
 *
 * It creates a specialized instance of {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone} which knows how to drag out of a {@link
 * Ext.grid.View GridView} and loads the data object which is passed to a cooperating {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone}'s
 * methods with the following properties:
 *
 * - `copy` : Boolean
 *
 *   The value of the GridView's `copy` property, or `true` if the GridView was configured with `allowCopy: true` _and_
 *   the control key was pressed when the drag operation was begun.
 *
 * - `view` : GridView
 *
 *   The source GridView from which the drag originated.
 *
 * - `ddel` : HtmlElement
 *
 *   The drag proxy element which moves with the mouse
 *
 * - `item` : HtmlElement
 *
 *   The GridView node upon which the mousedown event was registered.
 *
 * - `records` : Array
 *
 *   An Array of {@link Ext.data.Model Model}s representing the selected data being dragged from the source GridView.
 *
 * It also creates a specialized instance of {@link Ext.dd.DropZone} which cooperates with other DropZones which are
 * members of the same ddGroup which processes such data objects.
 *
 * Adding this plugin to a view means that two new events may be fired from the client GridView, `{@link #beforedrop
 * beforedrop}` and `{@link #drop drop}`
 *
 *     @example
 *     Ext.create('Ext.data.Store', {
 *         storeId:'simpsonsStore',
 *         fields:['name'],
 *         data: [[&quot;Lisa&quot;], [&quot;Bart&quot;], [&quot;Homer&quot;], [&quot;Marge&quot;]],
 *         proxy: {
 *             type: 'memory',
 *             reader: 'array'
 *         }
 *     });
 *
 *     Ext.create('Ext.grid.Panel', {
 *         store: 'simpsonsStore',
 *         columns: [
 *             {header: 'Name',  dataIndex: 'name', flex: true}
 *         ],
 *         viewConfig: {
 *             plugins: {
 *                 ptype: 'gridviewdragdrop',
 *                 dragText: 'Drag and drop to reorganize'
 *             }
 *         },
 *         height: 200,
 *         width: 400,
 *         renderTo: Ext.getBody()
 *     });

     *
     * Returning `false` to this event signals that the drop gesture was invalid, and if the drag proxy will animate
     * back to the point from which the drag began.

     * was valid, and that the repair operation should not take place.
     *
     * Any other return value continues with the data transfer operation.
     *
     * @param {Object} data The data object gathered at mousedown time by the cooperating {@link Ext.dd.DragZone
     * DragZone}'s {@link Ext.dd.DragZone#getDragData getDragData} method it contains the following properties:

     * of the node.
     *
     * @param {Function} dropFunction
     *
     * A function to call to complete the data transfer operation and either move or copy Model instances from the
     * source View's Store to the destination View's Store.
     *
     * This is useful when you want to perform some kind of asynchronous processing before confirming the drop, such as
     * an {@link Ext.window.MessageBox#confirm confirm} call, or an Ajax request.
     *
     * Return `0` from this event handler, and call the `dropFunction` at any time to perform the data transfer.
