</span> * This plugin provides drag and/or drop functionality for a TreeView.
 *
 * It creates a specialized instance of {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone} which knows how to drag out of a
 * {@link Ext.tree.View TreeView} and loads the data object which is passed to a cooperating
 * {@link Ext.dd.DragZone DragZone}'s methods with the following properties:
 *
 *   - copy : Boolean
 *
 *     The value of the TreeView's `copy` property, or `true` if the TreeView was configured with `allowCopy: true` *and*
 *     the control key was pressed when the drag operation was begun.
 *
 *   - view : TreeView
 *
 *     The source TreeView from which the drag originated.
 *
 *   - ddel : HtmlElement
 *
 *     The drag proxy element which moves with the mouse
 *
 *   - item : HtmlElement
 *
 *     The TreeView node upon which the mousedown event was registered.
 *
 *   - records : Array
 *
 *     An Array of {@link Ext.data.Model Models} representing the selected data being dragged from the source TreeView.
 *
 * It also creates a specialized instance of {@link Ext.dd.DropZone} which cooperates with other DropZones which are
 * members of the same ddGroup which processes such data objects.
 *
 * Adding this plugin to a view means that two new events may be fired from the client TreeView, {@link #beforedrop} and
 * {@link #drop}.
 *
 * Note that the plugin must be added to the tree view, not to the tree panel. For example using viewConfig:
 *
 *     viewConfig: {
 *         plugins: { ptype: 'treeviewdragdrop' }
 *     }

     *
     * @param {HTMLElement} node The TreeView node **if any** over which the mouse was positioned.
     *
     * Returning `false` to this event signals that the drop gesture was invalid, and if the drag proxy will animate
     * back to the point from which the drag began.

     * dragged from the source TreeView.
     *
     * @param {Ext.data.Model} overModel The Model over which the drop gesture took place.

     * @param {String} dropPosition `&quot;before&quot;`, `&quot;after&quot;` or `&quot;append&quot;` depending on whether the mouse is above or below
     * the midline of the node, or the node is a branch node which accepts new child nodes.
     *
     * @param {Function} dropFunction A function to call to complete the data transfer operation and either move or copy
     * Model instances from the source View's Store to the destination View's Store.
     *
     * This is useful when you want to perform some kind of asynchronous processing before confirming the drop, such as
     * an {@link Ext.window.MessageBox#confirm confirm} call, or an Ajax request.
     *
     * Return `0` from this event handler, and call the `dropFunction` at any time to perform the data transfer.
