## a fast, scalable game server framework for [node.js](http://nodejs.org)

Pomelo provides a basic development framework and many related libraries and tools to
speed up game development. Pomelo's distributed architecture allows it to scale better
than other web frameworks, so it is also suitable for real-time web applications.

## Why should I use Pomelo?

Creating a fast and scalable real-time game server is not a hard job, but it is made easier
by a good framework. Sadly, finding a game server framework solution is difficult, especially
if you favor open source. Pomelo's development model is similar to web development, so it 
is familiar to most developers.
