<p>Joose.Manual.MetaRoles - Yet another special kind of Roles in Joose.</p>

<h1 id="whatisameta-role">WHAT IS A META-ROLE?</h1>

<p>Meta-role is a usual role, applied to a meta-class instance. Because of that, meta-role is also a <a href="Traits.html">trait</a>.</p>

<p>Like any other Role, meta-role modifies the class, adding some re-usable behavior to it. Most probably this behaviour will be related
to the constructing of the class being modified, for example it will provide additional builders for class.</p>

<h1 id="applyingmeta-role">APPLYING META-ROLE</h1>

<p>Meta roles can be added to class using the <code>metaRole</code> or <code>trait</code> builders:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('Person', {

        trait : JooseX.Storable,

        has : {
            firstName : {},
            lastName  : {}
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>Here we declared a class <code>Person</code>, which metaclass instance (<code>Person.meta</code>) will have trait <code>JooseX.Storable</code> applied.</p>

<p>This trait probably provides the facilities to serialize the current state of the class and later restore it.</p>

<p>See <a href="../Cookbook/MetaRole.html">this</a> Cookbook recipe on how to create custom meta-role.</p>

<h1 id="removingmeta-role">REMOVING META-ROLE</h1>

<p>For symmetry, its possible to remove the meta-role, using <code>removeMetaRole</code> builder:</p>

<pre><code>    Person.meta.extend({
        removeMetaRole : JooseX.Storable
    })
</code></pre>
