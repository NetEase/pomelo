<p>Joose.Manual.Traits - Special kind of Roles in Joose.</p>

<h1 id="whatisatrait">WHAT IS A TRAIT?</h1>

<p>In Joose, a trait is almost exactly the same thing as a role, which is composed into an instance of a class at runtime to add or modify the behavior of <em>just that instance</em>. 
Other instances are not affected. </p>

<p>Any role can be used as a trait. There is no special <code>Trait</code> helper or other syntax constructs.</p>

<pre><code>    Role('Logger', {

        requires : [ 'process' ],

        before : {
            process : function () {
                this.log("'process' method was called with the arguments:" + arguments)
            }
        },


        methods : {
            log : function () {
                ...
            }
        }
    })


    Class('Parser', {

        methods : {
            process : function () {
                ...
            }
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<h1 id="applyingtrait.detaching">APPLYING TRAIT. DETACHING</h1>

<p>Traits can be applied only during object's instantiation. To apply the trait, provide the "pseudo-builder" <code>trait</code> (or <code>traits</code>) to class constructor:</p>

<pre><code>    var parser = new Parser({
        trait : Logger
    })
</code></pre>

<p>Now this particular <code>parser</code> instance will perform additional loging during work. Note that any other instances of <code>Parser</code> will not be not affected.</p>

<p>You may also return the <code>trait</code> builder from the <code>BUILD</code> method (if you are using custom parameters processing).</p>

<p>Under the hood, the <code>parser</code> instance will have its own instance of metaclass, separated from <code>Person</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    console.log(parser.meta != Parser.meta) // true, instance was detached
    console.log(parser instanceof Parser)   // true, its still Parser however )
</code></pre>

<p>You can <em>extend</em> this particular instance as usual class:</p>

<pre><code>    parser.meta.extend({
        does : AnotherLogger
    })
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't want to apply trait during object's instantiation, but planning to do it later, you need to create it as <em>detached</em>. Use pseudo-builder <code>detached</code> for that:</p>

<pre><code>    var parser = new Parser({
        detached : true
    })

    ...

    //later

    if (...) parser.meta.extend({
        does : Logger
    })
</code></pre>

<h1 id="removingtrait.">REMOVING TRAIT.</h1>

<p>You may decide to remove the trait (rememeber, all Joose classes are mutable at run-time).</p>

<pre><code>    parser.meta.extend({
        doesnot : Logger
    })
</code></pre>

<h1 id="traitsasmeta-roles">TRAITS AS META-ROLES</h1>

<p>Sometime traits are also mentioned in <em>meta-role</em> context. This means, that this trait is being applied to the instance of meta-class.
Such traits modifies the <em>behaviour of class itself</em> (its meta), not its methods or attributes. </p>

<p>An example of such trait can be a <a href="http://samuraijack.github.com/JooseX-Class-Singleton">JooseX.Class.Singleton</a>:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('Some.Class', {
        trait : JooseX.Class.Singleton,

        has : {
            ...
        },

        methods : {
            ...
        }
    })
</code></pre>
