<p>Joose.Manual.Mutability - Mutability and how to use it.</p>

<h1 id="whatismutability">WHAT IS MUTABILITY?</h1>

<p>All Joose classes are dynamic or "mutable". Joose lets you add/remove attributes or methods, apply/unaplly roles, etc - right in the run-time.</p>

<p>Any change in the base class (or consumed role) will be correctly propagated through the whole inheritance hierarchy (or composition relationships).</p>

<p>Almost all class builders have their's inverse pair - for example : <code>has</code> - <code>hasnot</code>, <code>methods</code> - <code>removeMethods</code>, <code>does</code> - <code>doesnt</code> etc.
To change the class, use the <code>extend</code> method of its <em>metaclass instance</em>, which is available as <code>class.meta</code>. It accepts an object with the new set of builders, much the same
as during class declaration:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('Woman', {
        isa : Human,

        does : Cry
    })


    Woman.meta.extend({
        doesnt : Cry,

        does : Laugh
    })
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Such changes will affect all instances of <code>Woman</code> class. If you need to only modify a particular instance, use <a href="Traits.html">Traits</a></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you'll re-compose some other Roles to your class at run-time, there are chances it will raise a <em>composition conflict</em>. Currently,
in such case an exception will be thrown, and a class will be leaved in incosistent state. </p>

<p>Some additional examples:</p>

<pre><code>    Role('Laugh', {
        has : {
            loudLevel : 10,
            laughType : 'kind'
        },

        methods : {
            laugh : function () {
            },

            giggle : function () {
            }
        }
    })


    Laugh.meta.extend({
        hasnt : [ 'laughType' ],

        removeMethods : [ 'giggle' ]
    })
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, immutable things are constructor and parent class. There is no invers builders for <code>constructor</code> and <code>isa</code> </p>
