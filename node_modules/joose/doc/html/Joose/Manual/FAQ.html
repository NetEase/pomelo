<p>Joose.Manual.FAQ - Frequently asked questions about Joose</p>

<h1 id="frequentlyaskedquestions">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>

<h2 id="modulestability">Module Stability</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is Joose "production ready"?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes! Many sites with household names are using Joose to build high-traffic services. Countless others are using Joose in production.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is Joose's API stable?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes. The sugary API, the one 95% of users will interact with, is very stable. Any changes will be 100% backwards compatible.</p>

<p>The meta API is less set in stone. We reserve the right to tweak parts of it to improve efficiency or consistency. This will not be done lightly. We do perform deprecation cycles. 
We really do not like making ourselves look bad by breaking your code. Submitting test cases is the best way to ensure that your code is not inadvertently broken by refactoring.</p>

<h2 id="constructors">Constructors</h2>

<ul>
<li>How do I write custom constructors with Joose?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, you should never write your own constructor, and should use Joose's other features to handle your specific object construction needs. </p>

<h2 id="accessors">Accessors</h2>

<h2 id="methodmodifiers">Method Modifiers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Can I use <code>before</code> to stop execution of a method?</li>
</ul>

<p>No, <code>before</code> modifier execute original method unconditionally. Use <code>override</code> or <code>around</code> modifiers instead. </p>

<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>

<ul>
<li>What are Traits, and how are they different from Roles?</li>
</ul>

<p>In Joose, a trait is almost exactly the same thing as a role, which is usually composed into an instance of a class at runtime to add or modify the behavior of just that instance.</p>

<p>Outside the context of Joose, traits and roles generally mean exactly the same thing. The original <a href="http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Scha02bTraits.pdf">paper</a> called them Traits, however Perl 6 will call them Roles.</p>

<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

<ul>
<li>Can I use Joose with Prototype or MooTools which defins their own global 'Class' symbol?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, you can use aliases Joose.Class, Joose.Role and Joose.Module to declare your classes.</p>
