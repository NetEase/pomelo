<p>Joose.Manual.JooseX - Recommended Joose extensions</p>

<h1 id="joosex">JooseX?</h1>

<p>It's easy to extend and change Joose, and this is part of what makes Joose so powerful. You can use the meta API to do things your own way, add new features, and generally customize your Joose.</p>

<p>Writing your own extensions does require a good understanding of the meta-model. 
You can start learning about it from this <a href="http://joose.it/blog/2010/10/03/joose-3-internals-part-i-meta-layers/">blog post</a>. 
There are also several extension recipes in the <a href="../Cookbook.html">Joose.Cookbook</a>.</p>

<p>Explaining how to write extensions is beyond the scope of this manual. Fortunately, lots of people have already written extensions and put them on JSAN for you.</p>

<p>This document covers a few of the ones we like best.</p>

<h1 id="joose.attribute">Joose.Attribute</h1>

<p>If you only look at one extension, it should be this one. It provides a lot of additional features for class's attributes, including lazy initialization, 
triggering, delegation and much more.</p>

<p>This lets you create much cleaner and fluent APIs.</p>

<pre><code>    Class('User', {
        has : {
            orders : {
                isa : Collection.Orders,

                handles : {
                    addOrder : 'add'
                }
            }
        }
    })

    -instead of-

    Class('User', {
        has : {
            orders : null 
        },

        methods : {
            addOrder : function (order) {
                this.orders.add(order)
            }
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<h1 id="joosex.namespace.depended">JooseX.Namespace.Depended</h1>

<p>This is very flexible implementation of dependency handling system for Joose classes, suitable for usage in production environments. 
It integrates directly into class creation process, and supports versioning:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('User', {
        VERSION : 1.23,

        isa : {
            Person : 1.15
        },

        does : {
            Administrator : 1.01
        }

        use : [ 'DashBoard.Reports' ],

        methods : {
            generateReport : function () {
                var report = new DashBoard.Report()
            }
        }
    })
</code></pre>

<p>The most interesting feature of <code>JooseX.Namespace.Depended</code> is a special "grouped" loading mode, in which it can load a class with any number of recursive dependencies (in-depth) with only 2 http requests
(requires a server-side component). </p>

<p><code>JooseX.Namespace.Depended</code> supports several transport layers (&lt;script&gt; tag, sync/async xhr, ServerJS), resource types (JavaScript, CSS, etc) and its very easy to add your own.</p>

<h1 id="joosex.bridge.ext">JooseX.Bridge.Ext</h1>

<p>If you are looking for DOM bindings library, running on Joose this extensions is right for you.</p>

<p>It replaces native class system of ExtJS framework with the Joose. The whole process is transparent for user and allows to write ExtJS classes using all capabilities of Joose:</p>

<pre><code>    Class('Test.Run.Harness.Browser.UI.TestGrid', {

        isa : Ext.grid.GridPanel,

        does : ExtX.grid.Grouped,

        have : {
            harness : null
        },

        before : {
            initComponent : function () {
                this.addEvents('rowselect')

                ...
            }
        },

        after : {
            initComponent : function () {
                this.getSelectionModel().on('rowselect', this.onRowSelect, this)

                ....
            }
        },

        methods : {
            onRowSelect : function (selModel, indx, record) {
                this.fireEvent('rowselect', this, record)
            }
        }
    })
</code></pre>
