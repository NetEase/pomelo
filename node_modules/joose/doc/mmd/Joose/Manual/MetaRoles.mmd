Joose.Manual.MetaRoles - Yet another special kind of Roles in Joose.


WHAT IS A META-ROLE?
====================

Meta-role is a usual role, applied to a meta-class instance. Because of that, meta-role is also a [trait][traits].

Like any other Role, meta-role modifies the class, adding some re-usable behavior to it. Most probably this behaviour will be related
to the constructing of the class being modified, for example it will provide additional builders for class.


APPLYING META-ROLE
==================

Meta roles can be added to class using the `metaRole` or `trait` builders:


        Class('Person', {
        
            trait : JooseX.Storable,
            
            has : {
                firstName : {},
                lastName  : {}
            }
        })

Here we declared a class `Person`, which metaclass instance (`Person.meta`) will have trait `JooseX.Storable` applied.

This trait probably provides the facilities to serialize the current state of the class and later restore it.

See [this][recipe] Cookbook recipe on how to create custom meta-role.


REMOVING META-ROLE
==================

For symmetry, its possible to remove the meta-role, using `removeMetaRole` builder:

        Person.meta.extend({
            removeMetaRole : JooseX.Storable
        })
