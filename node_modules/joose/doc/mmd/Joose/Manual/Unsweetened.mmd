Joose
=====

Lets imagine we have two simple classes in Joose:

        Class('Person', {
            has : {
                firstName : { is : 'rw', required : true },
                lastName  : { is : 'rw', required : true }
            },
            
            methods : {
                eat : function () {
                }
            }
        })
            
    
    
        Class('Person.Tidy', {
        
            isa : Person,
            
            has : {
                teethBrush : {
                    is : 'rw',
                    required : true
                }
            },
            
        
            before : {
                eat : function () {
                    this.washHands()
                }
            },
            
            
            after : {
                eat : function () {
                    this.brushTeeths()
                }
            },
            
            
            methods : {
                
                washHands : function () {
                    ...
                },
                
                
                brushTeeths : function () {
                    ...
                }
            }
        })


RAW JAVASCRIPT
==============

Now the same classes are rewritten in "raw" javascript (the functionality is strictly the same).

        if (typeof Person != 'undefined') throw "Namespace 'Person' is already allocated"
        
        Person = function (firstName, lastName) {
            if (!firstName) throw "Required attribute 'firstName' was not provided to constructor"
            if (!lastName)  throw "Required attribute 'lastName' was not provided to constructor"
            
            this.firstName = firstName
            this.lastName = lastName
        }
        
        Person.prototype = {
        
            getFirstName : function () {
                return this.firstName
            },
            
            
            setFirstName : function (firstName) {
                this.firstName = firstName
                
                return this
            },
            
            
            getLastName : function () {
                return this.lastName
            },
            
            
            setLastName : function (lastName) {
                this.lastName = lastName
                
                return this
            },
            
            eat : function () {
                ...
            }
        }
        
        //eof Person
        
        (function(){
        
            if (typeof Person == 'undefined') throw "Parent class 'Person' is not defined"
            
            if (typeof Person.Tidy != 'undefined') throw "Namespace 'Person.Tidy' is already allocated"
            
            
            //establishing inheritance chain
            var temp = function () {}
            temp.prototype = Person.prototype
            
            Person.Tidy = function (firstName, lastName, teethBrush) {
                Person.call(this, firstName, lastName)
                
                if (!teethBrush)  throw "Required attribute 'teethBrush' was not provided to constructor"
                
                this.teethBrush = teethBrush
            }
            
            var proto = Person.Tidy.prototype = new temp()
            
            
            proto.setTeethBrush = function (teethBrush) {
                this.teethBrush = teethBrush
                
                return this
            }
            
        
            proto.washHands = function () {
                ...
            }
                        
                        
            proto.brushTeeths = function () {
                ...
            }
            
            
            proto.eat = function () {
                this.washHands()
                
                var res = Person.eat.apply(this, arguments)
                
                this.brushTeeths()
                
                return res
            }
            
        })()


Wow, that was a mouthful! One thing to note is that in "raw" JavaScript the inheritance hierarchy is hard-coded - 
if you'll change the superclass of `Person.Tidy` you'll have to manually scan through the code and replace all call to `Person`.

Of course, there are several JavaScript frameworks that do some of what Joose does, like ExtJS, Dojo, Prototype, and so on. 
But none of them put together all of Joose's features along with a layer of declarative sugar, nor are these other modules designed for extensibility in the
same way as Joose. With Joose, it's easy to write a JooseX module to replace or extend a piece of built-in functionality.

Joose is a complete OO package in and of itself, and is part of a rich ecosystem of extensions. It also has an enthusiastic community of users, 
and is being actively maintained and developed.
