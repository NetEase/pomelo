Joose.Manual.Static - Static methods and attributes, "out of the box"


WHAT IS A STATIC PROPERTY?
==========================

Static method (or attribute) is a method, defined on the class itself, not on its instances. Its somewhat similar to singleton concept. 
Static methods often manage some system-wide state or set of helper functions.


SYNTAX
======

To declare a static part of your class use `my` builder:

        Class('TypeRegistry', {
        
            my : {
                has : {
                    types : Joose.I.Object
                },
                
                does : [ JooseX.Storable ],
                
                methods : {
                    registerType : function (type, value) {
                        ....
                    }
                }
            }
        })

You may use any usual builders inside of `my`, including method modifires, `isa`, `does`, etc. Static properties are also [mutable][] 


USAGE
=====

To access static properties "outside" of class context, use `my` property of its constructor, like
        
        TypeRegistry.my.types['someTypeName']
        
        TypeRegistry.my.registerType('textfield', Ext.form.TextField)
        
         
Static methods are also aliased to the constructor, so you can call them directly, w/o `my`:

        TypeRegistry.registerType('textfield', Ext.form.TextField)
        

Inside of *static* methods, *static* attributes are available via `this`. Inside of the *usual* methods, *static* properties are available via `my`: 

        Class('TypeRegistry', {
        
            my : {
                has : {
                    types : Joose.I.Object
                }
            
                methods : {
                    registerType : function (type, value) {
                        this.types[ type ] = value
                    }
                }
            },
            
            methods : {
            
                someMethod : function () {
                    this.my.registerType('someTypeName', someValue)
                    
                    this.my.types[ 'someType' ]
                }
            }
        })
        
        //or
        
        var registry = new TypeRegistry()
        
        registry.my.registerType('someTypeName', someValue)


ACESSING HOSTING CLASS
======================

If you need to access the constructor of the hosting class from static methods, add a special static attribute `HOST`.
During instantiation, it will be provided with the correct value: 


        Class('FileType', {
        
            has : {
                ...
            },
            
            
            methods : {
                ...
            },
        
        
            my : {
                has : {
                    types   : { init : {} },
                
                    HOST    : null,
                },
                
            
                methods : {
                    register : function (name, param1, param2) {
                    
                        // this.HOST == FileType
                        
                        this.types[ name ] = new this.HOST({
                            param1 : param1,
                            param2 : param2
                        })
                    }
                }
            }
        })

Static method `register` shown in the example will also correctly work in the subclasses of `FileType`.


INHERITANCE OF STATIC PROPERTIES
================================

Static properties are inheritable like any other. There are though some additional details you should take into account.
Under the hood, static properties implemented as a singleton class, and you can specify from what class it should inherit directly:

Direct inheritance
------------------

You may use `isa` builder to directly specify from what class your static part should inherit:

        Class('TypeRegistry', {
        
            my : {
                isa : Registry,
                
                ....
            }
        })

Direct inheritance has a highest priority.


Indirect inheritance
--------------------

Otherwise if the class have static properties they'll be inheried by this class subclasses:

        Class('Registry', {
        
            my : {
                ....
            }
        })

        Class('TypeRegistry', {
            isa : Registry
        })

`TypeRegistry` will inherit all the attributes of `Registry`, including static, which will be accessible as `TypeRegistry.my`. `TypeRegistry.my` will be a subclass of the `Registry.my` class. 


You may specify any additional builders, which will customize the static methods of subclass: 

        Class('TypeRegistry', {
            isa : Registry,
            
            my : {
                override : {
                    registerType : function (type, value) {
                        ....
                    }
                }
            }
        })

        
        
ROLES WITH STATIC PROPERTIES
============================
        
In addition to all this static wizardry you can create a role with static methods just fine:

        Role('TypeRegistry.Storable', {
        
            my : {
                has : {
                    storageId : { is : 'rw' }
                },
                
                override : {
                    registerType : function (type, value) {
                        ....
                    }
                }
            }
        })
        
Such roles should be applied in "indirect form", to the usual class, which should contain the static part, being modified.

        Class('TypeRegistry', {
            
            does : TypeRegistry.Storable
        })
