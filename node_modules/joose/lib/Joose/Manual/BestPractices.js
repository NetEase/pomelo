Joose.Manual.BestPractices - Get the most out of Joose


RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

Joose has a lot of features, and there's definitely more than one way to do it. However, we think that picking a subset of these features and using them consistently makes everyone's life easier.

Of course, as with any list of "best practices", these are really just opinions. Feel free to ignore us.


Best practice #1
----------------

This is very wise advise on using Joose properly.


BENEFITS OF BEST PRACTICES
==========================

Following these practices has a number of benefits.

It helps ensure that your code will play nice with others, making it more reusable and easier to extend.

Following an accepted set of idioms will make maintenance easier, especially when someone else has to maintain your code. It will also make it easier to get support from other Joose users, since your code will be easier to digest quickly.

Many of these practices also help get the most out of meta programming.
